        """(Deprecated) Create Upload

        Creating an Upload is the first step in associating a file to a resource in Procore. Creating an Upload can be seen as fetching instruction on how to post your file directly to Procore's storage service.  The instructions contain three properties: a UUID to reference the Upload, a URL which has to be used to post the file, and fields which need to be posted together with the file.  To upload the file you must POST to the URL in the _url_ property with a multipart/form-data body (see RFC 2388). Make sure to include **all** the names and values from _fields_ without altering them. The URL and fields necessary to complete the upload may vary between companies and may also change over time so none of these may be hard-coded. Finally add a field named _file_ with the actual file data.  Uploads are associated to the Company that owns the project so they can use company specific upload settings. The currently authenticated user will become the owner of the Upload and only that user can use the Upload in subsequent requests.  You will have to initiate the upload within one hour or you can expect a 403 Forbidden response. Other errors are usually clearly explained in the response body.  For an example of how to associate a finalized upload to another resource in Procore see the Photos resource. An Upload will have to be associated to another resource within a week or it will be automatically deleted from Procore servers.  Note that there is also a variant of this API endpoint that works using a Company ID.

        """Create Upload

        Creating an Upload is the first step in associating a file to a resource in Procore. Creating an Upload can be seen as fetching instruction on how to post your file directly to Procore's storage service.  The instructions contain three properties: a UUID to reference the Upload, a URL which has to be used to post the file, and fields which need to be posted together with the file.  To upload the file you must POST to the URL in the _url_ property with a multipart/form-data body (see RFC 2388). Make sure to include **all** the names and values from _fields_ without altering them. The URL and fields necessary to complete the upload may vary between companies and may also change over time so none of these may be hard-coded. Finally add a field named _file_ with the actual file data.  Uploads are associated to the Company that owns the project so they can use company specific upload settings. The currently authenticated user will become the owner of the Upload and only that user can use the Upload in subsequent requests.  You will have to initiate the upload within one hour or you can expect a 403 Forbidden response. Other errors are usually clearly explained in the response body.  For an example of how to associate a finalized upload to another resource in Procore see the Photos resource. An Upload will have to be associated to another resource within a week or it will be automatically deleted from Procore servers.  Note that there is also a variant of this API endpoint that works using a Company ID.

        """Create Upload

        Creating an Upload is the first step in associating a file to a resource in Procore. Creating an Upload can be seen as fetching instruction on how to post your file directly to Procore's storage service.  The instructions contain three properties: a UUID to reference the Upload, a URL which has to be used to post the file, and fields which need to be posted together with the file.  To upload the file you must POST to the URL in the _url_ property with a multipart/form-data body (see RFC 2388). Make sure to include **all** the names and values from _fields_ without altering them. The URL and fields necessary to complete the upload may vary between companies and may also change over time so none of these may be hard-coded. Finally add a field named _file_ with the actual file data.  Uploads are associated to the Company that owns the project so they can use company specific upload settings. The currently authenticated user will become the owner of the Upload and only that user can use the Upload in subsequent requests.  You will have to initiate the upload within one hour or you can expect a 403 Forbidden response. Other errors are usually clearly explained in the response body.  For an example of how to associate a finalized upload to another resource in Procore see the Photos resource. An Upload will have to be associated to another resource within a week or it will be automatically deleted from Procore servers.  Note that there is also a variant of this API endpoint that works using a Company ID.
